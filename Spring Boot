Enterprise-level application?
    * Large software system application
        complex, scalable, component-based, distributed, mission-critical.

          // Before spring Boot came the story
          java EE used as a web application before spring 
          Java SE extended is Java EE 
          java EE is a Specification set introduced by JAVA
          java EE needs to build a web application.
          application servers
            GlassFish
            Apache Tomcat
            JBoss
            jetty
            WildFly
          Too complex
          //
Why did spring come?
    * JAVA EE is more complex
    * Spring simplifies the Java development process 
Singleton Design pattern
    one object used for multi-purpose
 
    POJO used to simplify spring
      * Plain old Java object 
    dependency Injection
      * Used for making tightly couple to loosely couple
    Declarative 
        *aspects & common conventions
can't create objects using Interface
transaction? 
      when one data depends on two tales every tale should be handled together. That handling process is a transaction. 
What is a concern?
    behaviour of a class (behaviour == a transaction) 
cross-cutting concern?
    more than one class repeat one concern 
OOP?
    If crosscutting concerns exist (one concern used in many classes ) separate them from system services and apply them. That applies mechanism is OOP. 
Bean?
    * JAVA Bean - an object that was created by using JAVA spec.
        Qualities of JAVA Bean 
            1. Properties encapsulation.
            2. Has allargs constructor  
            3. Has no-args constructor
            4. Property names camelcase 
    *Spring Bean - Pojo (Plain Old JAVA Object)
    *When using @Component it shows as a bean
Dependency Injection Methods
      *property injection
      *constructor injection
      *setter methods
Does Servlet do on the web?
   handling request response 

JPA (Java Persistence API) 
   * Use Hibernate - Mysql, Java connecting ORM(object-relational mapping) tool 
   * Hibernate native API 
   * JPA

The data access part can be usin
   1. jdbc
   2. Orm tool
   3. Spring data jpa
