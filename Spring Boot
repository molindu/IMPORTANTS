Enterprise level application ?
    * Large software system application
        complex, scalable, component-based, distributed, mission critical.

          // Before spring Boot came story
          java EE used to web application before came spring 
          java SE extended is Java EE 
          java EE is Specification set introduced by JAVA
          java EE need to build web application.
          apllication servers
            GlassFish
            Apache Tomacat
            JBoss
            jetty
            WildFly
          Too complex
          //
Why spring came?
    *JAVA EE more complex
    *spring simplify java development process 
Singleton Design pattern
    one object used for multi purpose
 
    POJO uased to simplify spring
      * Plain old java object 
    dependency Injection
      * Used for makeing tightly couple to loosely couple
    Declarative 
        *aspects & common conventions
can't create object using Interface
transaction ? 
      when one data depend on two tales every tales should handle together. That handling process is transaction. 
What is concern?
    behaviour of a class (behaviour == a transaction) 
cross cutting concern?
    more than one class repeat one concern 
OOP?
    If crosscutting concern exist (one concern used in many classes ) it seperate from system services and apply it. That apply macanisum is OOP. 
Bean?
    * JAVA Bean - object that created by using JAVA spec.
        Qualities of JAVA Bean 
            1.Propoerties encapsulation.
            2.has allargs constructor  
            3.has no args constructor
            4. Property names camelcase 
    *Spring Bean - Pojo (Plain Old JAVA Object)
    *When use @Component it shows as a bean
Dependency Injection Methods
      *property injection
      *constructor injection
      *setter methods
servlet do in web ?
   handling request response 

JPA (Java Persistance Api) 
   * use Hibernate - Mysql, Java connecting ORM(object relational mappinf) tool 
   * Hibernate native api 
   *JPA

Data access part can using
   1.jdbc
   2.orm tool
   3. spring data jpa
